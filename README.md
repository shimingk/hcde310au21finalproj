# HCDE 310 Final Project - Simple Weather
*I would like to use P3 of my final project for **HW7**!*

## APIs used in this project
The two APIs I used in this project are:

- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) - the main API source for weather info in this proj.

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) - for the images of the places/cities based on the user's weather search

You will find the API keys I personally used for these APIs in `keys.py`
